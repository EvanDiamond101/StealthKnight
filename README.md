# A Knightly Heist

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/UzFZMUB.png" width="50%">

A game where the player takes the role of a time travelling knight, who has travelled into the future to steal artefacts from a museum.

The aim of the game is to collect as many artefacts as possible and escape back through the portal before you're caught by the guards.

This project was created in just over a week as a game jam.
